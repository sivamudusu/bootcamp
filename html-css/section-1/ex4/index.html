     <p>
        The choice of the custom charset, specifically ISO-8859-1, for the historical website dedicated to ancient scripts, such as cuneiform, is deliberate in its balance between generality and specificity. While ISO-8859-1 is primarily a Western European character encoding, it encompasses a wide range of characters, diacritical marks, and symbols relevant to the broader study of historical scripts. Given that cuneiform may not have a direct one-to-one representation in existing character encodings, ISO-8859-1 serves as a pragmatic choice that allows for the inclusion of Latin characters, numerals, and common punctuation marks. This enables the website to present information, descriptions, and scholarly discussions about ancient scripts in a readable and accessible manner. While specialized encodings may offer more precise representation, ISO-8859-1 strikes a balance, ensuring that the majority of characters required for broader linguistic and historical contexts are appropriately rendered on the website.
