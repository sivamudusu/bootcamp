     <!-- Your task: Write a paragraph describing how the viewport meta tag you included will help attendees view conference details and schedule on both desktop and mobile devices. -->
     <p>The viewport meta tag included in the HTML document plays a pivotal role in ensuring an optimal viewing experience for attendees accessing conference details and schedules on both desktop and mobile devices. By setting the content attribute to "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0," the viewport is adjusted to match the width of the user's device screen. This means that whether attendees are navigating the conference website on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, the content will automatically scale and fit within the viewport, eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling. The initial-scale attribute ensures that the default zoom level is set to 1.0, preventing any unintended magnification or reduction of content. This responsive design approach guarantees that attendees can effortlessly access and navigate the conference details and schedule, promoting a seamless and user-friendly experience across various devices.</p>
