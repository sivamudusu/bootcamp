    <h1>Dangers of Global Warming</h1>

    <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
    <section id="section1">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Global warming is a pressing issue that poses significant threats to our planet. This section provides an overview of the dangers associated with it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: Rising Temperatures -->
    <section id="section2">
        <h2>2. Rising Temperatures</h2>
        <p>One of the most concerning aspects of global warming is the continuous increase in average temperatures across the globe. Subsections within this section may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#subsec1">Heatwaves</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subsec2">Changing Climate Patterns</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Subsection 1: Heatwaves -->
        <section id="subsec1">
            <h3>2.1 Heatwaves</h3>
            <p>Heatwaves, with their scorching temperatures, have become more frequent and severe due to global warming.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Subsection 2: Changing Climate Patterns -->
        <section id="subsec2">
            <h3>2.2 Changing Climate Patterns</h3>
            <p>Global warming is disrupting climate patterns, leading to unpredictable weather conditions and temperature extremes.</p>
        </section>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Melting Ice Caps -->
    <section id="section3">
        <h2>3. Melting Ice Caps</h2>
        <p>The melting of ice caps and glaciers is a direct consequence of global warming, contributing to rising sea levels. Subsections within this section may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#subsec3">Sea Level Rise</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subsec4">Impact on Wildlife</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Subsection 3: Sea Level Rise -->
        <section id="subsec3">
            <h3>3.1 Sea Level Rise</h3>
            <p>Rising temperatures cause ice caps to melt, leading to the gradual rise of sea levels.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Subsection 4: Impact on Wildlife -->
        <section id="subsec4">
            <h3>3.2 Impact on Wildlife</h3>
            <p>The loss of ice caps affects the natural habitats and survival of various species, particularly those in polar regions.</p>
        </section>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Extreme Weather Events -->
    <section id="section4">
        <h2>4. Extreme Weather Events</h2>
        <p>Global warming has amplified the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events worldwide. Subsections within this section may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#subsec5">Hurricanes and Cyclones</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subsec6">Droughts and Flooding</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Subsection 5: Hurricanes and Cyclones -->
        <section id="subsec5">
            <h3>4.1 Hurricanes and Cyclones</h3>
            <p>Warmer ocean waters provide energy for stronger and more destructive hurricanes and cyclones.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Subsection 6: Droughts and Flooding -->
        <section id="subsec6">
            <h3>4.2 Droughts and Flooding</h3>
            <p>Global warming can lead to extended droughts in some regions and severe flooding in others, creating water-related challenges.</p>
