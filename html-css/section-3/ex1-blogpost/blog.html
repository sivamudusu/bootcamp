        <p>It’s safe to say that web development is far from dying. It continues to play a vital role in the digital world, powering websites, applications, and online experiences. <br>
            Its adaptability, the demand for custom web solutions, the expansion of e-commerce and online businesses, integration with emerging technologies, focus on user experience and accessibility, and the ongoing need for maintenance and security all contribute to its resilience.<br>
            It all depends on how you define web development. If you define it as coding, then no,<mark> web developers</mark> aren’t going anywhere. The demand for them will always be there because no matter how quickly technology changes, people will always need someone who can keep up with the latest <mark>computer programming languages</mark> and <mark>web design </mark>trends to help them create their websites or apps.

                    What does this mean? As the industry changes, developers are adapting to meet the needs of the public. For example, more and more people are turning to DIY platforms like Wix and Weebly that allow them to create their own websites.<br><br>
                    This means that web developers are evolving to keep up with these changes. They’re not at risk of becoming obsolete any time soon.<br><br>
                    The landscape of web development is rapidly evolving, but it’s not dying. Web developers may need to pivot in order to stay on top of new trends, but they’ll always be an essential part of designing digital projects for clients.

                    Is there a need for developers while DIY web builder platforms rise?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need for developers is far from dying, and we’re likely to see a boom in the need for web developers over the next few years.<br><br>
                    Many companies in the past, for example, didn’t have websites because they were not looking to market themselves online. As these businesses realized that their product or service was going to be sold on the internet and within a few years dramatically needed web development help from people with experience in this field.<br><br>
                    The problem is there wasn’t much of an option for them back then as it would cost more than hiring one person just for website content creation. Things like Wix themes had very limited designs and features which made it difficult to make changes without also knowing how code works too, so we still need a lot of help from web developers

                    Are people giving up on coding and learning because of new DIY web development platforms like Wix and Weebly, and more? Traditional web development is not dying. On the contrary, demand for web developers continues to rise. According to Code Academy founder Ryan Carson, “Demand for developers will always exist.”

                        <h3>The pros</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are many pros to building a website with Wix or Weebly. They’re easy to use, cost less than hiring a web design company, and there are no coding skills required. You can even add features like social media integration without any technical knowledge.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The cons</h3>
                        <p>
                            As DIY website builders like Wix and Weebly make it easier for anyone to build their own site, many people are saying that web development is dying because there’s no need for professionals.<br><br>

                            While it does seem true that these platforms have made it simpler for people to build their own websites, the cons of using them may outweigh the pros.<br><br>

                            For example, while they’re easy to use and can be a wonderful platform for one-time projects, you’re limited in the number of pages you can create and how much control you have over your design.<br><br>

                            The other downside is that the content on these sites is still not searching engine optimized (SEO) so ranking on Google can be difficult.<br><br>

                            It’s also worth noting that many of these sites offer free trial periods which means you’ll lose everything if you decide not to pay the monthly fee after a certain amount of time. And even if you choose a paid option, it may end up costing you more than hiring a professional developer in the long run!

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It’s been a roller coaster few years for web developers. Back in the early 2000s, it was hard to find a developer. Nowadays, a lot of people are giving up on coding and learning because of new DIY web development platforms.</p>
