        <h2>OSI Model</h2>
        <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with the layers adjacent to it. The seven layers of the OSI model, from the lowest to the highest, are as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical Layer (Layer 1)
                <p>The physical layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware elements of a network, such as cables, connectors, switches, and network interface cards (NICs). This layer is responsible for transmitting raw binary data over a physical medium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
                <p>The data link layer manages the direct link between two directly connected nodes. It provides error detection and correction, as well as the framing and addressing of data packets. Switches operate at this layer, making decisions based on MAC addresses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Network Layer (Layer 3)
                <p>The network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data packets between different networks. It deals with logical addressing (IP addresses), packet forwarding, and the creation of routing tables. Routers operate at this layer</p>
            </li>
            <li>Transport Layer (Layer 4)
                <p>The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication and manages flow control, error correction, and retransmission of data. It divides data into segments and reassembles them at the receiving end. Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at this layer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Session Layer (Layer 5)
                <p>The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions or connections between applications. It provides dialog control, synchronization, and data exchange. It helps in organizing and controlling communication sessions</p>
            </li>
            <li>Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
                <p>The presentation layer is responsible for translating data between the application layer and the lower layers. It manages data format translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data is presented in a readable format for the application layer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Application Layer (Layer 7)
                The application layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with end-user applications. It provides network services directly to end-users and applications, including email, file transfer, and network browsing. Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate at this layer.
            </li>
        </ul>
