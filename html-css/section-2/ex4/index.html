    <p>In HTML, a meta tag is an element that provides metadata about a document. Metadata is information about the data within the document and is not displayed on the web page itself. Meta tags are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and are typically used to provide information such as character encoding, viewport settings, and most importantly, metadata for search engines and social media platforms.</p>
