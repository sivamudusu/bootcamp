    <p>Character encodings are methods used to represent characters in a digital form, usually as binary code. There are several types of character encodings, each designed to accommodate different character sets and linguistic requirements. Here are some common character encodings</p>

    <ol>
        <li>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</li>
        <p>ASCII is a widely used character encoding standard that represents characters using 7 bits (128 characters). It includes basic Latin letters, numerals, punctuation, and control characters</p>
        <li>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit)</li>
        <p>UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of representing every character in the Unicode character set. It uses 8 bits for common ASCII characters and expands to 16, 24, or 32 bits for other characters</p>
        <li>UTF-16</li>
        <p>UTF-16 is another Unicode encoding that uses 16 bits for most characters but expands to 32 bits for characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). It's commonly used in environments where many characters outside the BMP are present</p>
        <li>UTF-32</li>
        <p>UTF-32 is a fixed-width encoding using 32 bits for each character, regardless of whether it's a common ASCII character or a less common Unicode character. It provides a straightforward representation of characters but is less space-efficient than UTF-8 and UTF-16</p>
        <li>ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)</li>
        <p>ISO-8859-1 is a character encoding that covers the Latin alphabet used in Western Europe. It includes characters for English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and many other Western European languages</p>
        <li>Shift JIS</li>
        <p>Shift JIS is a character encoding for the Japanese language. It uses variable-length encoding, where some characters are represented by one byte and others by two bytes</p>
        <li>EUC-JP (Extended Unix Code - Japanese)</li>
        <p>EUC-JP is another character encoding for the Japanese language, commonly used on Unix systems. It uses a variable-width encoding similar to Shift JIS.</p>
        <li>KOI8-R</li>
        <p>KOI8-R is a character encoding for the Russian language. It was developed for computers using the Cyrillic script and assigns characters to positions in the 8-bit range.</p>
        <li>Big5</li>
        <p>Big5 is a character encoding widely used for traditional Chinese characters. It uses a variable-length encoding, with most characters represented by two bytes.</p>
        <li>Windows-1252</li>
        <p>Windows-1252 is an extension of ISO-8859-1, adding characters for Western European languages and some special symbols. It is commonly used in Microsoft Windows systems</p>
